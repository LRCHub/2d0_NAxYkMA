Gonna take you off my list of to dos
I'm gonna sing my soul shake off these blues
Cause it's alright
It's alright now
When I wake up and I hear you say
There's no love worth chasing yesterday
Cause it's alright
It's alright now
Yes I know
I've been bold
I didn't do what I was told
Yes I know
You soft soap
You didn't do what I was told
I ain't looking for you nine to five
Sick of wasting my sweet precious time
Cause it's alright
It's alright now
Yes I know
I've been bold
I didn't do what I was told
Yes I know
You soft soap
You didn't do what I was told
Lay it on me, lay it on me, lay it on me yeh
Lay it on me, lay it on me, lay it on me yeh
Lay it on me, lay it on me, lay it on me yeh
Lay it on me, lay it on me, lay it on me yeh
Yes I know
I've been bold
I didn't do what I was told
Yes I know
You soft soap
You didn't do what I was told
Yes I know
I've been bold
I didn't do what I was told
Yes I know
You soft soap
You didn't do what I was told
